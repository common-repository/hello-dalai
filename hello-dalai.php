The very purpose of religion is to control yourself, not to criticize others.  Rather, we must criticize ourselves.
Sleep is the best meditation.
My religion is very simple.  My religion is kindness.
In the practice of tolerance, one&apos;s enemy is the best teacher.
Happiness is not something ready-made.  It comes from your own actions.
The main cause of suffering is egoistic desire for one&apos;s own comfort and happiness.
When you lose, don&apos;t lose the lesson.
We can live without religion and meditation, but we cannot survive without human affection.

Where ignorance is our master, there is no possibility of real peace.
When you realize you&apos;ve made a mistake, take immediate steps to correct it.

Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries.  Without them humanity cannot survive.
Anger is the ultimate troublemaker.
The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
If you have a particular faith or religion, that is good - but you can survive without it.
Some people, sweet and attractive, and strong and healthy, happen to die young.  They are masters in disguise teaching us about impermanence.
We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves.
Suffering increases your inner strength.  Also, the wishing for suffering makes the suffering disappear.
On a daily basis, you must take more care of your mind than just money, money, money!
World peace through hatred and force is impossible.
To foster inner awareness, introspection, and reasoning is more efficient than meditation and prayer.
The training of the mind is an art.  If this can be considered as art, one&apos;s life is art.
The ultimate authority must always rest with the individual&apos;s own reason and critical analysis.
What science finds to be nonexistent, we must accept as nonexistent; but what science merely does not find is a completely different matter . . . It is quite clear that there are many, many mysterious things.";
